Thanks, COVID.
There was some good music in 2020, so I've put together my list of ~40 albums. 
This is the 'Songs' section - a mixed bag of genre but all recognisably songs.

[Click here or scroll down for the Spotify playlist of the lot!](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4uOMKIBGCzvfxPqSk6SAiK)

**Hot Chip - Late Night Tales: Hot Chip - Nothing's Changed**  
Late Night Tales is a decent mix album, with a couple of new tracks.

**Owen Pallett - Island - Paragon Of Order**  
An early lockdown favourite. The whole album's beautiful.

**Bill Callahan - Gold Record - Let's Move To The Country**  
Never really been that much into Bill Callahan. This was clearly a mistake. Must go and listen to more.

**Destroyer - Have We Met - Crimson Tide**  
A favourite from the pre-Covid months. Fantastic album.

**The Mountain Goats - Getting Into Knives - As Many Candles As Possible**  
Two mountain goats albums in one year!

**Nadine Shah - Kitchen Sink - Ladies for Babies (Goats for Love)**  
Only picked this up in the last few weeks. How did I miss this? Great fun.

**Mark Lanegan - Straight Songs Of Sorrow - Ketamine**  
I'd listen to Mark Lanegan reading the news. Everything he does is great.

**Porridge Radio - Every Bad - Sweet**  

**The Lovely Eggs - I Am Moron - This Decision**  
Its the Lovely Eggs. Great album. Gutted not to have seen it live. Fingers crossed for next year.

**Hey Colossus - Dances / Curses - Dreamer Is Lying In State**  
Missed this one. Only picked it up from The Quietus' year end list. Wall of noise.

**The Orielles - Disco Volador - Space Samba (Disco Volador Theme)**  
The album is great fun from stasrt to finish.

**Róisín Murphy - Róisín Machine - Jealousy**  
Big album. All the remixes I've heard from it have been great too.

**Santrofi - Alewa - Kwabena amoah**  
No idea where I came across this one but I've listened to it pretty regularly for about 6 months now.

**Keleketla! - Keleketla! - International Love Affair**  
You will be singing this for days.

**Aesop Rock - Spirit World Field Guide - Button Masher**  
New Aesop Rock is always a good thing. Album goes in hard.

**Jeffrey Lewis - Keep It Chill in the East Vill**  
It's not really from an album, but its too much fun to not include.
