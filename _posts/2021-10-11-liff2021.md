desc: The return of the Leeds International Film Festival
---

Here we go! The 35th Leeds International Film Festival launches its programme this week, ahead of the first screening in November. I think its fair to say I'm a bit excited. 

Last year's last-minute scrapping of the whole festival was such a cruel blow. Mid-October we had a 3 tier system of lockdown (remember that?) and, as the film festival proudly announced, every one of the tiers allowed in-person cinema screenings, the festival was safe! Of course, at the very end of October the government announced Leeds would move into the (previously non-existent) tier 4. And all the screenings had to be scrapped. (And then actually they put the _whole country_ on lockdown just as few days later).

They made the best of it, and we watched a lot of stuff on the online player but it wasn't really the same. So this year it's _so exciting_ to be heading back into the cinema for it. Opening film is **Spencer**, which I'd struggle to care less about, but much like a music festival is never really about the headline acts, the film festival is all about the hidden gems. Fingers crossed for a good year.
