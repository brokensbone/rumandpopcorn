### Shit and Shine - 2222 and Airport
S&S produces a _lot_ of music, and a lot of it has never really connected with me. But this one does. By turns full of good beats, funny stories and weird noises. Excellent stuff.

### Squid - O Monolith
I don't love this _quite_ as much as their first, but its still great.

### Memorials - Women Against the Bomb
I was surprised by how much this stuck in my head. It's the soundtrack to a film about the Greenham Common protests and isn't subtle at all, but I keep finding myself singing little bits of it.

### Lankum - False Lankum
This is my kind of folk music. Macabre, dark stories, told over shuddering bass and weird noises. Fabulous.

### Hey Colossus - In Blood
Short and sweet, full of fuzzy guitar noise. 

### Meatraffle - Superstructure
Cracking post-punk tunes with some wickedly funny lines. 

### The Loving Paupers - Ladders
Gorgeous NY reggae. 

### The Mountain Goats - Jenny From Thebes
It's the Mountain Goats. It's a polished one, with horns and all. 

### Overmono - Good Lies
This is an absolute gem. Sits alongside Bicep's Atlas in my mind, and that's high praise.

### Warrington-Runcorn New Town Development Plan - The Nation's Most Central Location
Understated electronica. This one pulses and bubbles and fizzes. It's great.

### Mungo's Hi-FI - Past and Present
Mungo's are a reliable source of bangers, but this one is wall to wall. Absolute stomping tunes.

### Reverend Kristine - SAVED
OK, this won't be for everyone. It's deeply weird and not an easy listen but its fascinating and very memorable. I love it.

### Belbury Poly - The Path
Sleeper hit for me. It's _very_ understated. All gentles tunes with a little folksy storytelling. Worth giving some time to.

### Gaunt - Blind


### Jellyskin - In Brine
Leeds Leeds Leeds. Bringer of Brine was my most listened track of the year, and 'I was the first Tetrapod' can't have been far behind.

### James Ellis Ford - The Hum


### Goat - Medicine
Everything these folk make is excellent and this one goes hard. Psych-folk? Alt-fusion? Chant-rock? The internet has no idea how to classify them. It doesn't matter. This is ace.
