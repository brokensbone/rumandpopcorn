Gloriously bonkers Dutch film about a village falling out and forming two rival factions, each with their own brass bands. Cue people getting pushed into lakes, cows rampaging through a cafe and lots of elaborate schemes to hide a bandâ€™s worth of instruments from the local policeman. Lovely ðŸŽºðŸŽºðŸŽºðŸŽº
