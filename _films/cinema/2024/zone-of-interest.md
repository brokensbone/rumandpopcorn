Oof. Heavy stuff. There's a lot to like about this film - the whole "it could be any of us" angle is very cleverly done, and the natural acting to the static cameras gives it a really unusual feel. There's a little part of me that feels like I'd got the message from about 30mins in and that the rest didn't really achieve a lot, but I'm quibbling here: it's strong, powerful, memorable. Worth a watch.
