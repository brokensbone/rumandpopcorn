1. Richard Flanagan - Gould's Book of Fish
   - Tasmanian penal colony. Paintings of fish. Great
1. Benjamin Myers - The Perfect Golden Circle
   - Crop circles in the 90s. Decent
1. Donna Tartt - A Secret History
   - College weirdos get weirder. Uneven. Great bits
1. John Lanchester - Mr Phillips
   - Well written but a bit hollow. Dated
1. Geraldine Brooks - Year of Wonder
   - Plague village. Beautifully written but unrelentingly horrible
1. Leonardo Sciascia - The Day of the Owl
   - Very short but totally gripping. A murder in Sicily. Does the mafia even exist?
1. Pen Vogler - Stuffed
   - Totally fascinating history of British food and politics
1. Shirley Jackson - We Have Always Lived in the Castle
   - Well this was weird. Intense and spooky novella of two creepy sisters and their murderous past
1. Toby Litt - Corpsing
   - A decent page-turner thriller. Feels a bit early-noughties bloke-lit. Intentionally, I think.
1. Elspeth Barker - O Caledonia
   - An astonishing book. Gothic and gloomy, but funny too.
1. R.F. Kuang - Yellowface
   - Nice idea, but waaaay too much social media. Reading about Twitter is _boring_.
1. Kate Atkinson - Shrines of Gaiety
   - Post-war Soho drinking dens. Police, dancers, missing girls, dope. Fabulous stuff.
1. Angela Carter - Nights at the Circus
   - Utterly insane. From music hall to Siberia, with clowns, tigers and shaman.
