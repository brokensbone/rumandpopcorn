1. **Kate Atkinson - Cold Histories**
   Gripping and incrdibly well written. Perhaps too many shadows of 90s lad culture ?
1. **Vicente Luis Mora - Centroeuropa**
   One of the best I've read in a very long time. Magical realism in a muddy field in 1800s Prussia.
1. **Andrew Michael Hurley - Starve Acre**
   Grief and isolation and the crimes of the past. Very bleak and atmospheric.
1. **Oliver Burkeman - Mediations for Mortals**
   Essentially 4000 weeks chewed over and formed into daily nuggets. Very good all the same.
1. **Ben Gazur - A Feast of Folklore**
   Nice round up of a lot of peculiar traditions and beliefs. The devil will steal your potatoes!
