I'm not sure this one was worth digging out to watch. It's a light-hearted rom-com-with-mafia-boss-parents. I can just about imagine enjoying it on a listless afternoon at the cinema with a massive tub of popcorn. Or a post-pub video rental, which you mostly tak through...

Huge Grunt is a well-to-do auctioneer. His partner, Jeanne Tripplehorn, is a schoolteacher. But her dad? James Caan is a mob boss. And whilst the family (or, rather, The Family) welcome Hugh with open arms, they're pretty soon getting him mixed up in all sorts of mob capers.

It's a bit thin. Coming hot on the heels of The Godfather it was always going to be. But even so... eeesh.
