A better one that we've had in a while in film tag. I'd read the description and feared it was going to be a hard and very heavy watch. The pre-credits scene does nothing to change that - leering creeps in a club argue over who's going to take advantage of a drunk single woman. Thankfully, this the tone shifts a bit and moves towards a revenge-thriller, all the while hammering home the message that these men's behaviour is very much not OK.

It's a decent film, but after that first tonal shift, it never really went anywhere very unexpected. We'd pretty much predicted the plot after the first 20 minutes or so. Sure, there were some unpredictable details but nothing that you couldn't sort of guess would happen. We spent much of the 2hr runtime wondering if it would throw us off but it never did. As such, I reckon it could probably have been trimmed down a bit - there's probably a great 80 minute film in there somewhere.
