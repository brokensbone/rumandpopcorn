Is this a good film? Surely not really. It's definitely fun. And I think it's probably better than it really has any right to be. Cash in crossovers from toys and games are pretty much universally awful. But this isn't. Somehow, they managed to keep it just silly enough that it feels joyful and yet not so silly that it feels like a waste of your time. It's a _perfect_ plane movie.

And it has a cast of thousands of big name actors, which makes it a surprisingly useful film tag pick.
