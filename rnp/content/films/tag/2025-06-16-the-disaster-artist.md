A very good film tag entry! Though Alison Brie maybe didn't have the _biggest_ role in this one, she was certainly a central character and just look at the options for film tag out from here!

I don't know how much sense this will make to anyone who hasn't seen _The Room_. I imagine it'd still be an entertaining story but you'd definitely be missing something. The completely bonkers film project, mysteriously funded, full of terrible dialogue and worse sex scenes... it's hard to describe it in a way that remotely does it justice. This film gets a lot of its laughs for free just by lifting scenes wholesale from The Room (the credits sequence side-by-side reshoots are _incredible_). Both Francos do great jobs as the leads, but its the reactions from cast and crew that really make this film - how weird must the real life experience have been?
