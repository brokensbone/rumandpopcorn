Morgan Freeman has been in a lot of films. Many good, many bad. It feels almost silly to use a Morgan Freeman film tag link to take us to a forgotten mid 90s action movie but when you see he's co-starring with Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz... what more could you ask for?

I think it's fair to say this is not any of them's greatest cinematic piece but neither is it their worst. This is a competent, pacy thriller with some twists and turns. Weisz is a nery scientist (of course), Keanu is a baffled looking techy (of course) and Morgan Freeman is a wise and knowing gentleman (of course). Some kind of infinite energy source has been discovered. Cue goons, explosions, set-ups and chase sequences.

It's decent. The worst you can really say about it is it hails from a action movie era when female characters were universally _pathetic_. Weisz is massively underused here and basically swings between looking scared or relieved for most of the film.
