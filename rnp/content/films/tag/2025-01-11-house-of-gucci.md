This was more enjoyable than it felt like it ought to be. The accents were grating, the characters mostly rich and unlikeable but ... it had a certain charm. The first half, where we follow Adam Driver and Lady Gaga's ascent into the Gucci business is much better than the messy second half which races through time increasingly quickly. Not that it should have been any longer.
