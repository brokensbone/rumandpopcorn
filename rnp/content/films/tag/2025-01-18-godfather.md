It's a classic. I'd never seen it. I wasn't really sure what to expect.

First things, it's a pretty enjoyable story that rattles along at a fair pace. It's a _long_ film but it doesn't really feel like it, which is impressive. The first half (two-thirds?) is great. Marlon Brando's weary Godfather, and then the tensions between cool-headed Tommy and angry Sonny are all gripping. Al Pacino's return to assume the family throne lost me a bit though - the last chunk was still decent but never really grabbed me in the same way.
