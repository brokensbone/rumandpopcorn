Oh dear. 

This has all the elements it should need - excellent source material, great cast, art-deco period detail - but has been sxo thoroughly _Baz Luhrmanned_ that it feels like a bit of a slog. It's far too long. Baz's "desire to blend the music of the Jazz Age, associated with the 1922 setting of the story, with a modern spin" is pretty clumsy. Worst of all, though, is the lavish quantities of _astonishingly bad_ CGI. It' everywhere. Every external shot of the city or Gatsby's castle. The car journeys. The water. It's mind blowing that someone looked at the crummy computer rendering and thought "yeah, that's good enough". If you can't do it on a computer, do it on a set!
