As might be expected, I hadn't really got started on 2021 music for much of January. So instead, most of this mix is made up of a lot of new discoveries of old music, a few relistens (RIP DOOM) and just a couple of truly *new* tracks.

So here we go...


**Attica Blues - Deeper** starts us off. I love trip hop but its a bit before my time so I've never been very knowledgeable about it. Didn't know Attica Blues at all until Gilles Peterson played them earlier this year.

Next up is a double bill of MF DOOM tracks to go with the sad news on NYE that he'd died last year. It's hard to pick out specific tracks - I feel Doom works function much better as whole album that little snippets - but I've picked a couple anyway. First up is **Viktor Vaughn - A Dead Mouse** from the *Vaudeville Villain* album, one that I didn't really know very well but listed to a lot in January. Followed by **Madvillain - Figaro**, a classic piece of one of his most loved albums.


I don't know if its escapism from the grey cold weather or escapism from the grey cold lockdown but I've been listening to a lot of reggae lately, a lot of whch has come from *David Rodigan*'s excellent shown on BBC 1XTRA. So here's a triple of reggae cuts. First up is **The Loving Paupers - Enemy of History**. They're a contemporary New York band and their whole 2019 album, *Lines*, is great but this is my favourite track. After that's its **Macka B - Gentrification** a brand new track I've enjoyed a lot and then **Mafia & Fluxy - Horns of Jah Children**, a lovely re-recording of a clasic tune.


By far the oldest track on this month's playlist is **Roberta Flack's Compared To What**. It's another Gilles Peterson discovery that he played for its 60th anniversary and I just found myself singing over the following days.


**Kruder & Dorfmeister** brings us back to the 2020s, although it doesn't sound like it. I didn't really start listening to the dusty sounding beats on their 2020 album *1995* until the start of this year but its a firm favourite from start to finish. It's a similar story with the next track from **Four Tet - Parallel 4**. *Parallels* came out right at the end of lasy year but I didn't really get to it until the first couple of weeks of January. Great stuff.

The last pair up the ante a bit. We have the fab squelchy, bassy stomp of **Danny Breaks' - The Jellyfish**, an early 2000s track I listened to on repeat this month (need to check out more Danny Breaks!) and then the only true 2021 album of the lot: from *Isles* we have **Bicep - Saku**. There was some serious hype around this album and it was well justified, the whole LP is incredible. A strong early contended for AOTY 2021!
