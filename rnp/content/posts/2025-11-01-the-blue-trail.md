Yet another astonishing Brazilian film. We're in dystopian reality in which the
elderly are taken away to 'the colony' - from which they never return. But somehow
this sidesteps all the familiar dystopian vibes and is just an incredible journey
through a rural Brazil, full of interesting characters.

Just... don't drop the goo from the blue drool snail in your eyes, okay?
