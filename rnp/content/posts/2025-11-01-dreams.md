My first dud of this year's festival.

The premise is interesting enough - Jessica Chastain is a high-powered American,
all business-suits and chauffered cars, who has taken a younger Mexican lover
from the ballet academy she sponsors. Suddenly, he's no longer a bit on the side
in Mexico but has smuggled himself into the US and inserted himself into here life.

Unfortunately, I never really liked any of the characters.
At some point I found myself wondering why I was watching a small story of unpleasant
people being unpleasant to each other.
