Pros:

- This had some very cool visuals (I love rotoscoped animation!)
- Lots of cool atmosphere (fog, churches, beasts, witchcraft)
- Some of it was pretty funny.

Cons:

- Too many strands of story, which meant each was underdeveloped.
- Not enough werewolf.
- Felt way too long, even though it was a pretty tight 90mins.

I do think there's a good film in there, and a lot of talent, but this was too muddled
for me. The werewolf plot, evil priest plot, witchcraft plot and impotent baron plot
were basically all separate stories. In trying to do them all, none of them went very far.
