Well this was utterly ludicrous.

In Porto Alegre, Brazil, Mathias is an aspiring actor, competing for roles with his
flatmate, Fabio. Mathias hooks up via an app with a new man, and they quickly discover
how much they enjoy the thrill of having sex in public.
Unfortunately, this isn't very compatible with Mathias' fledgling TV career, and still
less compatible with Rafael's attempt to run for mayor.

There's some serious points in here about social acceptance of gay men (someone says
something like "gay men are accepted now. As long as they're private") but its rather
buried beneath the lurid, fast-paced plot - with sex in car parks, covert filming,
blackmail and violence.

It's quite good fun.
