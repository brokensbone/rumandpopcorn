A 100 year old cinema wonder, exploring the mysteries of space through cutting edge
film effects. We cover the history of human understanding of space, the individual
planets, the seasons, moons, and more. It's truly stunning stuff, although the highlights
are all the bits with people in (jumping in low-gravity on Mars! walking on the walls
of the spaceship!).

Matthew Bourne's live moog soundtrack was absolutely wonderful as well.
