Life in 1970s rural Brazil does not look fun.
We join Iracema, an anagram of America, in her precarious existence on the edge of the transamazonian highway.
There are moments of joy - markets, festivals, bars - but there is a lot of very hard, grim survival too.
Men are awful - aggressive, predatory, violent.
The women aren't much better.
Somehow Iracema scrapes by, sleeping with truck drivers for lifts, bartering for cigarettes and booze.

Meanwhile, the amazon burns in the name of progress.
