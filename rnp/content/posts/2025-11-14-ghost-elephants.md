A very Werner Herzog film.
Is it about looking for elephants?
Or about the very act of looking for things?
Or about obsession?
Or about mankind's inability to live in harmony with nature?
Or all of the above?

It's a powerful film, with some jaw dropping scenery, some glorious wildlife,
and a lot about the humans of the story - their different backgrounds,
their hopes, their fears.

The journey itself sounds completely insane -
1000 miles across almost untrodden ground in pursuit of some very big elephants.
They're all quite mad, but I enjoyed watching their madness.
