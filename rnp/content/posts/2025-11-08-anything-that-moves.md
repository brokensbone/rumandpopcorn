A love-letter to 70s and 80s giallo slashers. A mood, more than a story.

The story, such as it is, is ridiculous.
Liam is a food delivery rider who provides services on the side.
He's good at his job and in high demand from a series of Chicago oddities,
all keen to satisfy their kinks and perversions, with a pizza on the side.
But what's this? Clients are being brutally murdered? And Liam's in the frame?
The brutish police are closing in, a leather-gloved lurker holds a knife,
it's all getting dangerous.

I loved it. It made almost no sense but it was funny, rude, and fun to watch.
