A really powerful documentary. It centres on the right-to-roam movement,
and how their aims come into conflict with the landed gentry of the country.
Several landowners pop up and manage to be not-totally-awful human beings,
treading a fine line between holding on to their inherited wealth and, somewhat grudgingly,
consenting to share it.

The villain of the piece, who's name I didn't catch and don't care to research,
calmly looked in all directions and said "I own all that I can see. This is my garden.
And it's a fucking big garden". He went on to explain how Black people didn't really
belong in the countryside, and how the general public were mostly too "fucking stupid"
to appreciate the land. A horrible person, through and through.

The true star of this is Nadia Shaikh, who is both fierce and compassionate,
outspoken and humble. She's prepared to admit that she understands the landowners'
very human desire to hang on to what they possess, all the while advocating for change
that will benefit those not born into land ownership.
An inspiring spokesperson for the movement.
