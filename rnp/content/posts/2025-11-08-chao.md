An impressive, hand-crafted animated retelling of the Little Mermaid,
transplanted to a version of Shanghai in which big business and the King of
the Sea are quarrelling. Only the union of the Fish Princess and uh...
some junior guy at a shipping company can bring peace and unity.

It's fine. I did like a lot of the animation, and there were some lovely
scenes (including a surprisingly good car chase!), but I grew pretty tired
of the lead guy's entitled male whinging. I know, I know, the whole story
was a journey of developing his character and learning to be a better person
but... if you don't like the breakfast your fish princess wife makes for
you, maybe you should make your own breakfast, you chump. Instead of waiting
for her single female friend to step in and teach her how to cook like a
good wife. Urgh.
