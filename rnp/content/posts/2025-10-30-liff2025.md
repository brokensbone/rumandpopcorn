It's that time again! Armed with 30+ tickets (ok, we've scaled back a bit in recent years)
and a pencil-marked festival programme, I'm about to take a week of work to do very little
except sit in a dark room and watch films. I can't wait.

I've already forgotten what I've got picked out but that shouldn't matter. There's a big
and varied list of stuff - from horror to animation to classic to downright weird. Let's
go!
