A curiosity. An Estonian triptych of loosely connected stories.
It's a weird mix of serious issues
(Estonian economy, emigrating for jobs, domestic violence)
and uh... aliens.

There are some fun bits (removing all of one willing alien-experiment volunteer's limbs,
putting the other volunteer in some sort of alien washing machine), but also quite
a lot of ponderous bits.
