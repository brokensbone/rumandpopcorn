This is one of those slice-of-life documentaries, which thrusts you into the middle of
an under-represented community and just leaves you to draw your own conclusions.
We join the mountain shepherds of the Pyrenees. Life seems quite tough.
It's made tougher still by the re-introduction of the brown bear.

The goals of re-wilding and bring locally extinct species back are clearly good.
But the shepherds are understandably a little bit pissed off.
We follow their work, their lives, their troubles, as they deal with the ever-present
threat of the bears.
However much they're told the bears are solitary creatures that rarely attack livestock,
the trail of mangled sheep carcasses tell a different story.

As a documentary it was fine. Probably too long.
I'd have preferred something like 3 different tails of re-wilding conflicts.
Instead, we get nearly two hours on the mountains.
