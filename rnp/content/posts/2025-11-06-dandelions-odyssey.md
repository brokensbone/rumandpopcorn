An animated, dialogue-free journey, following dandelion seeds on a (surprisingly cosmic)
journey to where they can grow new plants.
Or, as an allotment gardener: proof that even if you nuke the planet, the damn dandelions
will manage to escape through a black hole to an alternate world and grow more weeds.

This was very beautiful, with a frankly jaw-dropping blend of live-footage and animation.
We see ferns unfurl, oyster mushrooms grow, and even make a getaway with a pair of slugs.
There's no escaping that it did still feel a bit long though, even at just 75 minutes.
This felt like a very cool 30 minute episode that someone had extended into a film.
And I could have done with a bit less anthropomorphizing the seeds. That got old fast.
