Archive footage spanning decades of European train journeys.
This was an interesting effort but I'm not sure it was edited as tightly as it could have
been.
After a pretty tense and at times gruesome middle section which covered the war wounded,
Nazis on a train and all that Nazis do, the final third or so just sort of fizzled out.

Though I could imagine it'd be pretty cool with live music accompaniment.
