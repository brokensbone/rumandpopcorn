The first part of a Halloween Grace Glowicki and Ben Petrie double bill, Honey Bunch is one of those
tense horror-thrillers that does a lot with a little. A cast of barely more than 6 people.
A single location (creepy old house, now eccentric rehabilitation centre, natch).
Bonus points for actors playing more than one role.

The experimental-cure that's a-bit-more-creepy-than-you-first-expect is well trodden ground,
and I don't think I'd claim Honey Bunch does anything terribly unexpected:
we've seen most of these characters and locations before, but it does its thing with conviction and
is a fun watch. Always at risk of veering into being a little campy horror (the dour nurse, the intense
husband - there are touches of _League of Gentlemen_) but they manage to keep it surprisingly straight-faced,
even as the plot gets weirder.

Bechdel pass too!
