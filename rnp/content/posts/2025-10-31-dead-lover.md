The second part of the Grace Glowicki double bill is even weirder.
Taking inspiration from Frankenstein and German Expressionist cinema,
this is a bonkers little feature.

We join our lonely gravedigger - unable to find a lover because she just
smells too much of death. The next hour and half is a bonkers journey
involving fights with wolves, sea journeys, gossiping locals, growing roses,
growing people (!) and, of course, some lightning-based reanimation.

It's quite wonderful.
