Documentaries are always hard to comment on really. Are you appreciating the film?
Or just agreeing with the points the film made?

_In Symbiosis_ is pretty much as right-on as it comes. We cover GM crops, pesticides,
insect death, industrial fertilizers, the world bank's debt strategy, colonial famine,
soil structure, happy cows and more.

If that sounds like a lot... it is. It definitely tries to be holistic in its approach
but for me that just meant it covered too many things too quickly. It was also noticeably
short on answers. We had lots of stats about how bad things were but very few about
how to fix it. It's all very well some cheerful organic farmers explaining their
processes but how will it feed all the people?

Interesting, thought provoking, but ultimately a little short on ideas.
