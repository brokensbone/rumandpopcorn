Very much my sort of horror. This is a solid entry in the "it's rough being a teenage
girl" genre, with a gentle touch of supernatural thrown in.
For me, the pacing was spot on. It felt slow but with a constant sense of threat,
that only very rarely bubbled to the surface.
Natalia and friends are all falling for Diego, but he's been swept away by worldly, older
Silvia. Natalia's anger and hurt surface in sudden moments of violence and power (or are
they just accidents and power-cuts?). It's menacing and threatening without ever being
gratuitously _nasty_. I loved it.

Though Diego seemed like a berk.
