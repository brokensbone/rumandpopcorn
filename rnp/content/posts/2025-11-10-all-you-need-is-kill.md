Quite good fun. It's basically _Russian Doll_ meets _Day of the Triffids_.
A Groundhog day scenario playing out over and over again, every time the character dies.
And there are some giant plant monsters which do seem quite intent on making that happen.

It's well put together, has some pretty cool scenes and builds the fairly familiar
repeating day theme nicely.
