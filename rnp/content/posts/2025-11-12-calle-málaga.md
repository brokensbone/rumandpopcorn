The wonderful Carmen Maura is a retired widow, living alone in the bustling city of Tangiers.
Her daughter, keen to make money by selling the house, pushes her out and starts a
sequence of events that are all about finding community and conversation and purpose.

It's a small film in its way. But its an absolute joy to watch Maura pottering through
the city, coming up with schemes and badmouthing those who wrong her to a silent nun.

An interesting counterpart to [the Blue Trail](/rnp/content/posts/2025-11-01-the-blue-trail.md)
which told a story of an older woman lead, muscled out of her routine by her daughter,
forging her own path (in a _very_ different way!).
