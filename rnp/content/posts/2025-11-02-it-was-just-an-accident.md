We were always going to see the new Jafar Panahi film.
After _Taxi Tehran_ and _No Bears_, you can sign me up for any new film from Panahi.
And more broadly, _all_ of the Iranian cinema we've seen at the film festival
has been gold.

This, fresh from winning the top prize at Cannes, is no different.
It's a fairly simple premise:
what do you do if given the chance to take revenge on your torturer?
And the story doesn't do anything massively unexpected.
But Panahi's films are about the characters and they're all just so human.
