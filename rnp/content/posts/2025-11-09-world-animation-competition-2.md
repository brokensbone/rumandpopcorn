And part 2! A _slightly_ weaker selection to my mind, with all 3 of my favourites coming
from the other programme. Star for me here was the lovely handmade vibe of Progress Mining

> Monday morning at the Progress Mining Company is a decaying, cubist nightmare of monotony.
> As one worker shows round a new employer, another campaigns for its closure and reconstruction,
> as the long-buried secrets of Sector Three quickly come to light.
