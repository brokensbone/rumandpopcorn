A CEO is kidnapped in small town America.
Her conspiracy-theory obsessed captors don't want money.
They want an invite to her mothership.
Things get weird.
It's Yorgos Lanthimos. _Of course things get weird_.

I loved this. Having seen a lot of hostage-and-kidnappers films, this never felt even
slightly familiar. It was always going somewhere new and unexpected.
Jesse Plemens and Aidan Delbis were astonishing as the cousin kidnapper duo,
and Emma Stone is fabulous again.
