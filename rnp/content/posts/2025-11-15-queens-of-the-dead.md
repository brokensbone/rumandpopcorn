A zombie romp set around a drag club night in Brooklyn.
It's a well made, well paced one.
Having been very into zombie films for a long time its a while since I've seen one,
and this is knowing, funny and silly, but places the zombie element with sincerity.

There are some very funny set pieces, weapons you might not expect, and it's all round
a decent little zombie film. Nice.
