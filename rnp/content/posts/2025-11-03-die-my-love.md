Ooh this one was a bit intense.

Jennifer Lawrence puts in a _stunning_ performance as a new mother, with postnatal
depression spiralling into dangerous madness.
Her and Robert Pattinson's sexy, carefree lives have taken an abrupt turn.
The ranch of dead uncle Frank has become a prison. The baby is crying. The dog is howling.

Throughout this film Lawrence is absolutely captivating and terrifying.
She spins, wild-eyed and cackling from one scene to the next, a frenzied nervous energy
always on the brink of explosion.

I nearly didn't see this - it sounded heavy, more than thrilling - but I'm so glad I did.
Absolute edge-of-the-seat stuff, and surely the best thing Lawrence has done so far.
