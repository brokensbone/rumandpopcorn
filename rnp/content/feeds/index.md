RSS feeds forever!

Rum and Popcorn has a number of different feed options:

### [All Content]({{< relref path="index.md" outputFormat="rss" >}})
This is a full text feed of literally every piece of content, by date, limited to 20. 
This includes posts, walks, films and any other content I might add.

### [Posts]({{< relref path="posts/index.md" outputFormat="rss" >}})
This is probably the one you want. Full text feed of blog posts, by date, limited to 20.


### [Walks]({{< relref path="walks/index.md" outputFormat="rss" >}})
Just the walks. This is not full text as these are displayed on a map. The feed includes a link to the page and a link for the GeoJSON file.

### [Films]({{< relref path="films/index.md" outputFormat="rss" >}})
Full text feed of short film "reviews" (they're hardly that, more just notes to myself)
