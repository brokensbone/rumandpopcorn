This was a pleasant loop walk. It feels a little perverse to drive all the way to Brimham rocks and then just promptly ignore them, but that's what you do.

There's an interesting litle church at Hartwith (St Jude's). Further round, we were sad to discover the only on-route pub has closed. What a shame.

### Parking 
Brimham Rocks car park. It'll get _busy_ on a nice summer's day but was fairly empty in January. Â£10 parking fee if you're not a National Trust member. 

### Walking
It's mostly fairly clearly marked paths and never really gets too hard - although there are some uphill bits.
