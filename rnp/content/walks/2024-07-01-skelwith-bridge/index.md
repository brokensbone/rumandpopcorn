This is a lovely lake district loop walk that takes in a good bit of variety.

We start off riverside, walking through a close canopy of trees, making our way slowly up a hill. Eventually this gives us a good view of Skelwith Force waterfall.

Coming out of the woods, the walk cuts along the edges of hillsides, drops down to cross the valley and then works its way up to Little Langdale. There's a nice looking pub here (The Three Shires Inn) but it was a bit early in the walk for us to stop.

We cross over into the next valley and drop down into Elterwater. Here we do stop. The Britannia serves up cool, pale beer on a hot day. And scampi fries.

From here it's a simple, gentle stroll along Great Langdale Beck, passing Elter Water lake and then on to Skelwith bridge.



### Parking 
Skelwith Bridge. All the off-road parking was for customers of the various places to stay, but we had no problem parking on the side of the road.

### Walking
10k over some hilly ground but never particularly steep or challenging.
