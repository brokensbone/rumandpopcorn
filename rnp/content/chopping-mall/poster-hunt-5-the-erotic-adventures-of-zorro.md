What with November being quite busy and the [poster for The Killer Shrews](http://choppingmallfilms.blogspot.com/2009/11/killer-shrews.html) being quite so fab, Poster Hunt got left somewhat by the wayside this month.  
  
Still, just over half-way through, the showcase of fabulous and/or strange posters returns with the [Erotic Adventures of Zorro](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068545). How classy.
