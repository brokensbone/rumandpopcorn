Chopping Mall was my first blog, which I started way back in 2009. 
It was dedicated exlcusively to ridiculous and terrible films, which
I watched a _lot_ of back then. (So much time, so little work!)

I've resuced the posts from oblivion, to be preserved here for ...uh... whatever.

It's a pretty clunky process getting them out of blogspot (XML export, eww)
and into here, so there may be a few formatting issues.
