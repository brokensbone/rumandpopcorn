From Nuisance Films comes two fabulous minutes of blood-drenched splatter horror. Though the fiom does cram a fair amount into it's tiny running time, I shan't say an awful lot here... save to say there are zombies, videogames and heaps of blood.  
  
This was made for an ever-so reasonable Â£80 by Paul Shrimpton and Alex Chandon. Paul has previously won the Zone Horror 'Cut!' short films competition ([with the, also excellent, 'Hung Up'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN_pBrdLZUk)) and this film is definitely a film worth several watches. I just hope he makes something longer soon!
