After wading through a lot of horror recently (especially Vampires!), I was begining to feel the need to turn my gaze to something a little different. At this point, I usually sit down to choose between my other two favourite genres; is it to be Spaghetti Western or camp 80s Dystopian thrills?  
  
I chose the camp 80s dystopia and [World Gone Wild](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096465/) certainly didn't disappoint.  
  
Made in the 80s? Check.  
A desert world where water has become the most precious commodity? Check.  
Adam Ant as a bad guy? Check.  
Killer frisbees, motorbikes, gunfights and moonshine? Check, check, check, check.

It would be grossly unfair to call this a b-movie by numbers - it's not, it's exciting and original - but I think it'd be true to say that it does more or less some up my idea of what a b-movie is.  
  
From the opening voice-over telling us just how ruined the world is (no rain in 50 years), the crappy camera effects in the opening credits and the entirely amazing theme song ([AVAILABLE ON YOUTUBE HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bMfK4r9AG4)) you just know what kind of movie this is going to be. The bad guys will sneer, the world will be full of wreckage and rubble, people will have regressed into a shouting, snarling, gambling, boozey mass, a dashing hero will save the day, everything will be fine. Needless to say, all of these things are true. The thrill of World Gone Wild is not that any part of it is unexpected, shocking or particularly innovative, just that it's really good fun!  
  
Disengage brain, open a beer, cook some popcorn; this is a film that is made to be enjoyed. From Adam Ant's wonderful smirking bad-guy to the villagers with their 80s haircuts, defending their livelihood with a wall of abandoned cars, if you like dystopian films, 80s cheese or b-movies in general, you can't fail to enjoy this.
