**It's been an absolute _age_ since the last Poster Hunt blogpost - there hasn't been one since July 2010! But today I stumbled upon a picture that was just _too_ good not to revive the long-forgotten series. A pedant might well point out that this appears to a cover rather than an actual poster but... pfft! Who listens to pedants anyway?**  
  
So here is the beautiful artwork for **MOLD!** It looks a pretty fabulous film, so I might have to give a watch some time soon.
