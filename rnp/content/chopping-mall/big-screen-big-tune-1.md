Having recently written a bit about the film OST, I tohught I might as well start a series of posts dedicated to the best soundtracks and theme-tunes around. So here is the rather fabulous [Green Slime](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064393/).  
  
The youtube video was put up by the [Uranium CafÃ©](http://uraniumcafe-the.com/), which is a very good blog if you're interested in these kinds of things...  
  

> Open the door you'll find the secret  
> To find the answer is to keep it  
> You'll believe it when you find  
> Something screaming 'cross your mind  
> Green slime  
>   
> What can it be, what is the reason  
> Is this the end of all that breathes, and  
> Is it something in your head?  
> Will you believe it when you're dead?  
> Green slime, green slime, green slime
