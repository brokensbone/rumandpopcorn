Ok, ok, it's been a while. This blog hasn't been updated in faaaar too long.  
  
Not to worry though. Half of the reason for this is that, in volunteering at the Leeds International Film Festival (the UK's biggest outside London, apparently), I've been way too busy watching films towrite much about them!

So, coming very, very soon will be reviews of every single film I've seen as part of the festival. Let's go! Dr Strangelove, Huacho, A Town Called Panic and many many more to come!  
  
Starts tomorrow, stay tuned!
