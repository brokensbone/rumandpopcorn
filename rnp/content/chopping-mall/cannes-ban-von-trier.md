Oh dear, oh dear, Lars von Trier has certainly upset the Cannes-folk, hasn't he?  
  
Does anyone really not see how ridiculous this is? Has anyone who does insist that it was a very serious issue actually [seen/heard the video](http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/video/2011/may/19/lars-von-trier-nazi-cannes?intcmp=239)? He preceded the comments by pointing out that his next film was a four hour long hardcore porn film starring Kirsten Dunce. With no dialogue.  
  
  
This man is bored. This man is bored of the dull routine of press conferences and he rambles off on a provocative wander. He clearly has no idea where this ramble is going and laughs at himself throughout. So you don't like the humour? Fine, I can't say I'm wild about it either, but the "von Trier is a Nazi" headlines that everyone has been churning out just seem like willful media aggression. Which is pretty pathetic.

But the media are the media, they're always been smug hypocrites. Luckily, the Cannes organizers are above all that ... just as bad. It'd be bad enough that they were dismissing him for what was clearly a joke, given with all the other stuff they've put up with, if it weren't for the smiling face of [Emir Kusturica](http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/video/2011/may/19/lars-von-trier-nazi-cannes?intcmp=239) who's running this year's Un Certain Regard competition at Cannes. This is the same Kusturica who has very seriously made comments suggesting an extent of support for Milosevic.. Suddenly, Lars jests don't look so important...  
  
Edit: [The Daily Beast have a very interesting post with a response from von Trier](http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-05-19/persona-non-grata-lars-von-trier-explains-nazi-comments-at-cannes-film-festival/).  
  

> “It was stupid and the wrong place to be sarcastic,” von Trier admitted. “Of course, I don’t sympathize with Hitler. And, as we all know, the Holocaust was the cruelest and most barbaric crime against humanity of the last century … My only excuse is that if I think a press conference is getting boring I start to perform. \[...\] The reason that I make these Jewish jokes is that, for half my life, I thought I was Jewish. If you’re Jewish, you’re allowed to make Jewish jokes. So it’s hard to break that habit when you find out that you’re not really Jewish. All of my children have Jewish names. I’m sorry that people took it the wrong way. But I know why; I was stupid enough to talk to the world like I talk to my best friends.”

What we have here, as so many times before when the world reacts with shock to particularly callous/offensive remarks is an absolute lack of context. The people at the press conference are familiar with von Trier's style (there is plenty of laughter or at least nervous tittering through the video) and the people who watch von Trier's films are familiar with his style. It's only when remarks given in a closed circle spread (inter)nationally that things start to kick off and the apoplectic rage blinds everyone...

Anyway, if nothing else, this gives me an excuse to stick a couple of awesome Nazi-themed posters from sleazey films in this post. So without further ado, here's

[Deported Women of the SS \[rate:4.9\] 154 votes](http://imdb.com/title/tt0074395/)

and

[Red Nights of the Gestapo \[rate:4.7\] 104 votes](http://imdb.com/title/tt0076337/)

. Quality, family-friendly entertainment, I'm sure...![Link](http://www.blogger.com/img/blank.gif)
