Poster Hunt was going to be an exploration of the most incredible movie-posters. The sublime, the ridiculous and the wonderfully crass.  
  
Following on from the last though, which scored higher in the crass stakes than I could have hoped for before I found it, I am sticking with the (deservedly) much maligned Nazisploitation genre...  
  
Here, without further ado, is the poster for your new favourite film...

Wow.  
  
Described on [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071161/) as "In the last days of WW2, women are volunteering from all over Germany to serve in the front lines by having sex with the brave Nazi soldiers..."
