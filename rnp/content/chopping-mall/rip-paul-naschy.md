Sad, sad news today that Spanish horror writer, director and star [Paul Naschy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Naschy) has died from cancer at the age of 75.  
  
Over the years he's starred in [loads of films](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0596701/), most famously a series of werewolf films ([The Mark of the Werewolf](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063275/) imdb) as well as countless other horror films and a handfull of satires and dramas set in Spain, which only became possible as the years of Franco-era Spanish censorship faded away.  
[  
El Pa√≠s has a Spanish language article here](http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cultura/Fallece/75/anos/actor/Paul/Naschy/icono/terror/elpepucul/20091201elpepucul_5/Tes).  
  
Sad day.
