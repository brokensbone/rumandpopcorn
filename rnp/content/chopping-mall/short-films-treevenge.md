It's hard to know what to say about a short film as funny, gory, mad and wonderful as [Treevenge](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1343750/).  
  
The short, clocking in at about 16 minutes, is a couple of years old and comes recommended by a sackful of film festival awards, including an honourable mention at Sundance and audience-fave short at Toronto After Dark, as well as Best Short from Rue Morgue magazine.  
  
I can see why!  
  
The premise, though nothing especially inventive, is enjoyable and clearly gave the film-makers enormous scope to have some fun. It's Christgmas, the goose is getting fat, and all over Canada Christmas trees are being butchered by chainsaw-wielding, slack-jawed lumberjacks intent on inflicting maximum pain on the poor trees. After a very funny opening with snarling mencutting up hilariously subtitled and squealing trees, we see the trees brought into the typical family home, ready for the "best Christmas EVER!"  
  
I think you know what follows. Several minutes of top-notch, tongue-in-cheek, laugh-out-loud slaughter, splatter and gore as the enraged trees go on a killing rampage, wreaking havoc upon their would-be tormentors.  
  
It's gory, it's funny and it's beautiful. I can't recommend it highly enough.  
  
The whole thing, in it's 16minute glory, is available to [watch on youtube here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vaiv7kAXBzM), or embedded below. I \*presume\* Yer Dead films don't mind it being there, and I can't see any purchase details on their website.
