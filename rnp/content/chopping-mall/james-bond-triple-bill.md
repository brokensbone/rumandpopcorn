**So, from the exciting introduction to the Bond universe that _Dr No_ provided, I moved along (chronologically, of course) to a trio of films that pretty much embody what James Bond _is_. These films are the very peak of 'Bond-ness', they're so jam packed with all the exciting (and ridiculous) tropes that came to define the the Bond film as a series that it's no surprise that _Austin Powers_ found the vast majority of its material here - some of the scenes are almost shot-for-shot identical!**

**From Russia With Love (1963 / Terrence Young / Sean Connery)**

**Goldfinger (1964 / Guy Hamilton / Sean Connery)**

**Thunderball (1965 / Terrence Young / Sean Connery)**

  
Both _From Russia With Love_ and _Thunderball_ feature Spectre plots for our heroic agent to battle, whilst _Goldfinger_ is much more of a one-man villain. _From Russia_ takes us from the early form of _Dr No_ and ramps it up by throwing a whole lot more excitement at it. Bond now has some serious gadgetry (albeit relatively basic) and his quick-assembly sniper rifle is particularly useful. We also meet some of the most fabulously _English_ of scenes - the foreign spy on the train who gives himself away by drinking red wine with fish! What a mistake! Sean Connery, as ever, is fabulous throughout but I couldn't help feeling that, whilst _From Russia_ threw an awful lot of exciting elements at the plot, the structure of the story itself was slightly lacklustre. Like _Dr No_, it had it's peaks and a few very memorable moments but as a film it was certainly lacking something.  
  
_Goldfinger_, easily one of the very best of Bond, takes all the elements that _From Russia_ contained and turned them up a bit. Rosa Klebb's killer shoe becomes Oddjob's killer hat, a comparatively timid attempt to steal a code-machine becomes an audacious plot to irradiate all of America's gold, etc. etc. _Goldfinger_ turns the heat up - and possibly overdoes it. Here then, we find lasers! gadget cars! sprayed gas! an implausibly strong Korean! and all sorts of other madness.

I'd call it a film of hits and misses: when it gets it right, it gets it very right indeed... but occasionally it's not quite so strong. A prefect example of the latter would be the extended Bond vs. Goldfinger _golf_ showdown. I'll repeat that: golf. I mean, whoever thought to set a dramatic encounter over a (long) game of golf? When we've been teased with bullet-proof cars and tear-gas briefcases, an elaborate ball-swapping plot that centres on Bond's recognition of the Slazenger 5 golf ball is... boring.  
  
That said, some of the scenes are undeniable classics. The sight of Bond, strapped to a chunk of metal with a high-power metal-cutting laser edging ever closer towards painful emasculation is as unforgettable as James Bond films get. It would be sublime even without dialogue but the now classic exchange "Do you expect me to talk / No Mr Bond, I expect you to die" is so wonderfully blunt that it just makes the scene perfect.  
  
The only thing, to my mind, that really stands in the way of _Goldfinger_ being the absolutely perfect Bond film is the utterly ridiculous names used throughout. So Goldfinger likes gold? And his first name is _Auric_? Like the element? And his odd job man is er... called OddJob? And the major plan to contaminate Fort Knox is called Operation GrandSlam? And the sex-interest woman is called _Pussy Galore?_ All this and more: _Goldfinger_ is about as subtle as a sledgehammer. Whilst I'd never demand a thoughtful or challenging Bond film, _Goldfinger_ does occasionally feel like it's treating us like idiots. I had _absolutely_ understood that the sexy woman would have sex with Bond without her being named Pussy Galore (suitably mocked by _Austin Powers'_ Alotta Fagina). It's, sadly, the kind of choice that makes this film feel so dated - even more than its two predecessors.

The last time I saw _Thunderball_ - where we're back with Spectre and have a plot of nuclear-ransom - was before the _Austin Powers_ films; it's hard to watch it in the same way now. We get scenes in the Spectre lair with 'number one' frying his cheating agents (whose steaming, but now empty, chairs return to the table), an eye-patched villain and a fantastic opening scene with a Spectre agent dressed as a grieving widow. Bond doesn't actually shout "That's a man, maaaaan!" but I could here it in my head...  
  
As a film _Thunderball_ is the most coherent and elaborately plotted yet but (for all that I teased _Goldfinger_) it lacks some of the more outrageous fun. There's no decent villain - eyepatch man does little besides giving grumpy orders - but there are some decent scenes (chase scene through the carnival!) and it does hang together as a pretty decent film. Sadly, there are far too many dull action sequences for it to be a true classic... Underwater scenes galore here and none of them are much fun. Some stirring music isn't enough to save a long, slow, flippers-and-wetsuits harpoon-battle snooze of a scene in what ought to be the most exciting part of the film.  
  
Despite some flaws in each, these three Bond films are a pretty exciting triple-bill of action fun and, taking over where _Dr No_ left off, make a convincing case for crowning Sean Connery as best Bond ever. From here, there's only one more Connery-Bond left before we come to George Lazenby's disasterous effort...
