We're back.  
  
It's been a long, long absence but - like many a zombie - the fact that Chopping Mall looked dead didn't mean that it was dead. Not at all.  
  
Instead, Chopping Mall returns refreshed, renewed and reinvigorated for a new year, nay, a new decade of exciting, gorey, thrilling films. I plan to broaden the scope of the blog a little; wheras previously it was almost all reviews, with the occasional special news piece, the new year should welcome in a little more film criticism, cinema news and history and all sorts of exciting fun.  
  
For now though, I'll review in 10 words or less the films I watched (or re-watched) over the Christmas period. Here we go....  
  
1\. G-force  
Surprisingly good fun with animated guinea-pigs. Unexpected treat.  
  
2\. Paranormal Activity  
Not half as scary as everyone said. Dull.  
  
3\. Murder Party  
One of the best independent films of recent times.  
  
4\. Where Eagles Dare  
Brits, Yanks, Nazis. Guns. 'Splosions. Cable-cars. Awesome.  
  
5\. The Commander  
Lee Van Cleef. Donald Pleasence. Otherwise rubbish.  
  
6\. Cemetery Without Crosses  
Spaghetti western fun of the highest order.  
  
7\. Muppet Christmas Carol  
Possibly Michael Caine's career highpoint?  
  
8\. Meteorites!  
Absolute crap.  
  
9\. Run, Man, Run (Corri, Uomo, Corri)  
Sequel to the Big Gundown. Not half as good.  
  
10\. Shanghai Noon  
Not enough Jackie Chan. Too much Owen Wilson.  
  
11\. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon  
Your Wu-Dan is a whorehose.  
  
12\. Inglorious Bastards  
That damned armoured train.  
  
13\. The Mercenary  
One of the best Westerns ever.  
  
14\. Boa Vs. Python  
Snakes. Snakes. Snakes. Guns. Snakes. Boring.  
  
15\. Doghouse  
Awesome Brit-Zombie flick. Might be worth a re-watch.  
  
16\. Avatar  
Paper thin plot in staggeringly beautiful 3D.  
  
17\. Die Screaming, Marianne  
Started well, middled bad, ended worse. Avoid.  
  
18\. Muppet Treasure Island  
Best film ever?  
  
19\. Ipcress Files  
Michael Caine with no muppets. Still pretty good.  
  
20\. Black Dynamite  
One of 2009's best. DYNAMITE, DYNAMITE!  
  
21\. Inglourious Basterds  
Best film of the year? I think so.  
  
  
  
Bring on the new year!
