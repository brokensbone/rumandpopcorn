Yeah, yeah, yeah, we all know that Ennio Morricone was the true king of the Spaghetti Western soundtrack but there were definitely some others out there too!  
  
For the second Big Screen, Big Tune, we present Luis Bacalov's theme song for Django.  
  
  
  
Chorus: django!  
  
Django, have you always been alone?  
  
Chorus: django!  
  
Django, have you never loved again?  
Love will live on, oh oh oh...  
Life must go on, oh oh oh...  
For you cannot spend your life regreatting.  
  
Chorus: django!  
  
Django, you must face another day.  
  
Chorus: django!  
  
Django, now your love has gone away.  
Once you loved her, whoa-oh...  
Now you've lost her, whoa-oh-oh-oh...  
But you've lost her for-ever, django.  
  
When there are clouds in the skies, and they are grey.  
You may be sad but remember that love will pass away.  
  
Oh django!  
After the showers is the sun.  
Will be shining...

Oh oh oh django!  
You must go on,  
Oh oh oh django...
