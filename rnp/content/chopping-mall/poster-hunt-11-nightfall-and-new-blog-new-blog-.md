First up, here's a Poster Hunt for July.  
  
Here are a couple of posters for Jaques Tourneur's Nightfall ([IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049552/)) from 1957, starring Aldo Ray, Brian Keith and Anne Bancroft. I don't write much about the films for these Poster Hunt posts (as I select them for artwork rather than the film - most of them I haven't seen), so if you do want to know more about the film I'll direct you to this [comprehensive blog post](http://www.noiroftheweek.com/2007/08/nightfall-1957.html) at [Noir of the Week](http://www.noiroftheweek.com/).

Every day for five years? That's quite a claim!

Secondly, I'd like to introduce you to Chopping Mall's edit: **SHORT-LIVED, NOW DEFUNCT**) new sister blog, [Cult Collage](http://cultcollage.blogspot.com/). The focus of this one will be mostly pictures (although music might feature occasionally too) and it'll pick up on interesting film and non-film related ephemera. It's pretty difficult to describe what I intend it to be; I think a collection of interesting images sums it up best, with a leaning towards pulp-art.  
  
Currently it only has the 11 Poster Hunt pages from this blog but it'll be updated often (far more often than this one) with other interesting posters, leaflets and ephemera.  
  
So head over to:
