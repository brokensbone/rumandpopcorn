Of course, all that Dario Argento film watching wasn't just for fun, it was all to build up to the fantastically exciting screening of Suspiria tonight in the [Bradford International Film Festival](http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/nmem/biff/11/index.asp). It's hardly going to be worth me reviewing it - I love the film so much already a review will probably be just a string of superlatives and smiley faces - but I'm hoping that, given the big screen treatment, I'll find even more to love about it!
