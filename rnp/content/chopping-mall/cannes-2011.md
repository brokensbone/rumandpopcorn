So Cannes 2011 starts tomorrow, everyone's favourite round-up of often pretentious, frequently over-serious and yet still usually fantastic film. There's almost no point getting too excited about any of the films on the actual bill because, months down the line when they actually get a release, the interest usually wears off before I get to actually see them. So I'm taking a fairly laid-back approach to it this year, mostly just reading the occasional review or summary. Or I might read everything I can find. We'll see...  
  
Neither [Empire](http://www.empireonline.com/News/story.asp?nid=30720) nor [Total Film](http://www.totalfilm.com/news/cannes-2011-line-up-announced) have much up yet for Cannes besides the month-old line-up announcement. More from them to come soon, I'm sure... [The Guardian's Cannes section](http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/cannes-2011) has a predictably thorough-but-earnest [Peter Bradshaw analysis](http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/may/08/cannes-2011-top-10-preview) of the main contenders up, whilst Mark Kermode [is not going](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/markkermode/2011/05/no_cannes_do.html) ([he's not much of a fan](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1985492.stm)).  
  
But what about the films themselves? Well, to be honest, very few of them are really shouting to me. I'll keep half an eye out for the Lars Von Trier contribution (Melancholia) and Almodóvar's latest (The Skin I Live In) whilst Takashi Miike's Hara-Kiri: Death Of A Samurai certainly has potential (Peter Bradshaw, needless to say, is not interested!).  
  
Half the fun, however, is usually to be found in keeping an eye on the mad as can be films in the marketplace, fighting desperately for distribution deals. There're almost always a good few horror and other indie gems to look out for there, so I'm sure that's where my attention will be focused.
