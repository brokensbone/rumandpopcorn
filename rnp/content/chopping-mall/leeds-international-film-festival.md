**This week sees the return of the UK's biggest film festival outside of London! Hurrah! I've [enjoyed lots of pretty great films at LIFF over the last couple of years](http://choppingmallfilms.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/Leeds%20International%20Film%20Festival) (and have regularly promised far more reviews than I've actually written), so I'm looking forward to some more.**  
  
This year I'm lucky enough to be doing some work there - which sadly means I won't get to see half as many films as in previous years (booo!). So I'm going to preview a few I'm looking forward to (and might actually get to see) here.  Over the next couple of weeks I also plan on watching a handful of the festival films I can get my hands on and putting them up here. Obviously these will mostly be the older one - I'm not likely to find a DVD copy of Russian zombie flick _Meteletsa_, which is getting it's world premiere here in Leeds - but there should be a few interesting things to watch. My very own festival outside the festival.  
  
In terms of things to look forward to, though, I'm spoilt for choice.  The most alluring horror treat, to my mind, is the sinister looking Mexican  flick, _Here Comes The Devil_ (_Ahi va el diablo_), which swept the horror awards at the last Fantastic Fest. I might actually get to see this one and am already pretty excited.  There's a decent spread of homegrown horror too: _Heretic_ and _Before Dawn_ both look particularly exciting. The latter is a straight-faced zombie movie - something all too-rare since _Shaun of the Dead_.  Whether either of them can possibly match last-year's glorious bloodbath of nastiness, _Inbred_, remains to be seen...  
  
In terms of classics, there's _Django_, _The Shining_, _King Kong vs. Godzilla_ AND _Return of the Living Dead_. All on a big screen! Coo! Sadly, I think I'll miss all of them. I might get to see _Matango: Fungus of Terror_ though, which should probably make up for it somewhat.  
  
Actual film reviews coming soon. Expect Belgian wheelchair-bound comedies and Canadian SciFi oddities amongst other things.
