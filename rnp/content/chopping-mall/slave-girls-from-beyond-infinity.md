**Oh they don't make 'em like this anymore. Armed with an invincible title like that, a budget the size of a shoebox and ambitions the size of an alien planet, how _could_ you go wrong? SGFBI is a masterclass in campy sci-fi film that could teach modern snoozefests a thing or two...**

Firstly, it's not nearly as sexual as its title would suggest. Nowadays, a film with the words "Slave Girls" in the title would almost certainly be pretty unpleasant. Instead, this fast-paced little flick just throws a couple of prison-escapees into a foreign jungle planet and follows their adventures. There's hardly anything by way of gratuitously sleazy scenes and it's all the better for it. The two women, Daria and Tisa, on a bid for galactic freedom, crash land on a strange and (at first) apparently deserted jungle planet.  
  
Soon enough, they meet the _outrageously_ camp 'Zed', who is master of this private planet and lives in a stone fortress with his two robotic henchmen (I'm not making a word of this up...).Â  Invited to slip into something more comfortable and join him for dinner (which includes a bizarre son-et-lumiere theremin interlude...) Daria and Tisa meet two other crash-victims who are stuck on Zed's planet. Before long, they realise that the sinister hunting-enthusiast Zed has been taking his unwilling 'guests' out and hunting them in his jungle gardens.

SGFBI clocks in at a tiny 75 mins. In that time we get space travel, intrigue (!), horror (!), theremins (!), robots and jungle. A good third of the film is taken up by Zed's attempt to hunt the three girls through the jungle. The other guest in Zed's personal playground is sadly not so lucky and is crossbowed (is that a verb?) early on.  
  
I need to say a quick word about the robot guards who, apart from being fabulously designed, are apparently also tempted by curvaceous ladies and have a pretty hilarious argument. Read the following in Dalek voices:  
Robot 1: The Maaaaaster will not be pleased with your aaabscence!  
Robot 2: _You_ displease _MEEEE!_ Aaaand I ignorrrre _YOOOOUUU!_  
R1: I'm going to inform the maaaaaasteeeerrrrr!  
R2: Tattle-t_aaaaaaaaaaa_lle!

They're awesome, this is awesome, the sets look like they're made of sponge and carboard and _Slave Girls From Beyond Infinity_ is more fun than it surely has any right to be!
