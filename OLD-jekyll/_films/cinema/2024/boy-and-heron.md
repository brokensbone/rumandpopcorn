Whisper it - has Ghibli made a film that is just too Ghibli? It's beautiful, of course, and full of weird and wonderful creatures, of course, but the plot starts out as gently bonkers before descending into fully unhinged chaos. The second half is far too much like someone trying to tell you their dreams.
