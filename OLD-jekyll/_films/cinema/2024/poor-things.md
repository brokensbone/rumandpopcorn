Lanthimos strikes again! This is a ridiculously wild ride, full of a cast having an absolute ball. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo are clearly having a great time, gurning and staggering around the dreamlike alternate world. I don't think I've seen anything for a long time where I had so little clue what might happen next.
