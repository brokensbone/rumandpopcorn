A loop walk taking in two lakes, with nice views of Coniston Water too.

Set off from Coniston and follow the Cumbria way uphill. A fork in the path leads you up into the woods, still climbing uphill, with good views back over Coniston water once you emerge.

Snake back and forth up the hillside and then follow the ridge along. We leave footpaths and follow a single-track road up through the ferns to the National Trust car park at Tarn Hows. Get coffee. It's good.

Tarn Hows has an accessible loop path, so its easy walking for a while. Loop around very nearly the whole lake. Stop to say hello to the ducks.

Just before completing the loop, turn off and follow the water downhill (Tom Gill). There's some good waterfalls here. 

Just before hitting the road, turn and walk parallel to it. Soon there's a crossing, follow through and emerge by Yew Tree tarn. We follow alongside it for nearly its whole length before turning to walk uphill. Skirt the edges of the woodland, looking up at the imposing Long Crag above.

From here it's all fairly easy. Nice wide path that meanders through the valley, eventually being joined by the Cumbria way. We follow it up and over the hill, meeting the place we forked off from it at the start and then dropping down into Coniston.

Time for a beer.

### Parking 
We were staying in Coniston so no need, but there's a public car park in the middle too.

### Walking
14k. Quite a lot of ascent but never too much in one go. Terrain was mostly very easy.
