A (mostly) bright and sunny day. A nice loop around Newmillerdam, taking in the lake, some woods, crossing the old railway line and wandering through the abandoned buildings in Seckar woods. Nice walk.

### Parking 
Public car park by Newmillerdamn. It's not huge and does get very busy.

### Walking
Easy. Mostly flat, mostly not too muddy - even after weeks of rain.
