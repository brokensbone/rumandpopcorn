### Who?
Rumandpopcorn.com is run by Ed Salkeld. 

Find me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/edsalkeld).

### How?
This is a static site built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The source is all on [GitHub](https://github.com/brokensbone/rumandpopcorn/) and the site is hosted on my domain. I did a post on the [setup of the web stack here](/2023/08/webstack/).

### Why?
Who writes blogs? Who reads blogs? I don't know. But I quite like them still. 

### Privacy
RumAndPopcorn tracks nothing. There's no Google Analytics, no ads, no 3rd party data brokers. There's no cookie data, browser fingerprinting, or any of the other grim practices that are widespread on the modern web.
