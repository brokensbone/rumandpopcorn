The allotment is all looking very pretty and springy. The daffodils are all starting to open up and there's a single magnificent red and yellow tulip. In the next allotment over, the blossom is looking lovely.

We've put the very first things in the ground. It's still a little early by all accounts (Leeds' last frost is the first week of *May*!) but I'm a bit impatient. So I've sown some radishes. Just a few, in two neat little rows. We'll see if they actually come to anything in the next couple of weeks.
