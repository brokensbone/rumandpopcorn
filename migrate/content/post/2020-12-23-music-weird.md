title: Best Music of 2020 - Part 3 Weird
---

There was some good music in 2020, so I've put together my list of ~40 albums. 
This is the 'Weird' section - there's nothing in common here except that they don't quite fit anywhere else. And I love them all.

**Heather Leigh - Glory Days - All I Do Is Lust**  
One of the best albums that is very much a product of lockdown. Echoes of deserted dancefloors.

**The Mountain Goats - Songs for Pierre Chuvin - Until Olympius Returns**  
What do you do when Covid cancels recording sessions? Write an album of acoustic songs about old pagans, of course.

**Harmonious Thelonious - Plong - Höhlenmenschenmuziek**  
**Nuel - Fantasia - The Running Flow**  
**Hotspring - Obit For Sunshade - Resounding**  
**Nihiloxica - Kaloli - Gunjula**  
Genuinely know nothing about any of these but I've been playing them all year. Hard to describe any of them well but the Nuel album may well be the best of the year.

**Nídia - Não Fales Nela Que A Mentes - Tarraxo Do Guetto**  
Everything Nidia does in fantastic. I'm still kicking myself for passing up an opportunity to see her live a couple of years ago.

**Lyra Pramuk - Fountain - Gossip**  
This is an interesting one. Every sound on the album is Lyra's recorded voice, manipulated and chopped.

**Duval Timothy - Help - Fall Again**  
An impossible to define album. It does jazz, piano solos, gospel, sampling. Fascinating.

**Mary Lattimore - Silver Ladders - Silver Ladders**  
**Sarah Davachi - Cantus, Descant - Ruminant**  
Both really beautiful albums. Mostly wordless, rewards slow listening.

**Lina, Raül Refree - Lina_Raül Refree - Os meus olhos são dois círios**  
One of the most interesting of the year. Fado, stripped of guitars and reimagined.

**Rian Treanor - File Under UK Metaplasm - Debouncing**  
Wow this album. Hard to listen to, hard to imagine anyone dancing to. Sits somewhere between music and noise.
