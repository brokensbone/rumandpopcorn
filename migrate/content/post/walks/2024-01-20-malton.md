title: Malton to Westow

A nice round trip from the middle of Malton down to Westow and back. The first good stretch follows the course of the river Derwent Southwards. We've had some miserably wet weather and then some very cold weather afterwards. It's a good thing we did - if the lakes of mud weren't frozen this might have been really difficult.

Eventually we part from the river and cross a couple of fields to go past St Mary's, which is a fascinating little church in the absolute middle of nowhere. It's sadly kept locked, but we had a look at the graveyard, which had stones dating back to the 18th century.

We stopped for a pint in the Blacksmith's Arms in Westow (Ossett Blonde). It looks a nice pub, but was more restaurant focussed than we were going for.

The walk back was fairly straightforward - we climbed up the hill and just took a fairly straight line back to Malton. It crosses a farm or two, some fields of (very excitable!) horses and through the middle of a golf course. 

### Parking 
Not sure! We stayed in Malton so didn't need to park

### Walking
It's a good long way, with a lot of it along a muddy riverbank.
