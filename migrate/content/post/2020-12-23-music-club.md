title: Best Music of 2020 - Part 2 Club
---

There was some good music in 2020, so I've put together my list of ~40 albums. 
This is the 'Club' section - from full on disco to some proper techno.

**Romare - Home - Gone**  
**Beatrice Dillon - Workaround - Square Fifths**  
**Kelly Lee Owens - Inner Song - Melt!**  
Three fantastic albums from very different UK producers. All of these work as long-play albums in their own right.

**Jupiter Jax - No Such Thing - Moods No Grooves**  
**Shinichi Atobe - Yes - Yes**  
I don't know very much about either of these, but both albums are great fun.

**Horse Meat Disco - Jump Into The Light - Jump Into The Light - Aeroplane Remix**  
This album's been a long time coming. Joyous stuff.

**Georgia - Seeking Thrills - Tuff City Kids Remix (Edit)**  
Actually found the album a little disappointing but this single is big, and the remix even bigger.

**Ellen Allien - Auraa - True Romantics**  
**Damian Lazarus - Flourish - Into The Sun**  
Now we're talking. Some of my favourite techno from this year.

**Faithless - All Blessed - Synthesizer (feat. Nathan Ball)**  
New Faithless! No idea how this manages to be both totally cheesy and thrilling. Had the album on repeat for a week.

**Luke Vibert - Luke Vibert presents Amen Andrews - Bad Boy Acid**  
Vibert dropped 3 monster releases back to back, covering breaks, rave and rave-hop. It's all great.
